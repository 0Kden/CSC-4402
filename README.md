# CSC-4402
This is the database my group members and I created as our final project for CSC-4402.

## Abstract
Libraries dole out a critical role in the Education industry. It is considered as the brain of any education institute, be
it small or large schools, colleges, or universities. With the development of digital content, it becomes more important to
manage the catalog of educational information with a scalable and reliable Library Management System that will support the
general requirement of the library. Easy to use campus library management systems are now available for stress-free
management of campus libraries of any size. A trustworthy web-based library management system provides a complete
resolution for students, librarians, and faculty members. In this project, we want to design and create a Library
Management System that can help librarians maintain the database of new books and the books that users borrow along with
their due dates. This system completely automates all your library's activities.
